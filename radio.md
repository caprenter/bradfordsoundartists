# Bradford Sound Artists Radio

Our radio show is a way to share sound and music that we find interesting with an audience that might be equally curious.

The show is broadcast on [CAMP Radio](https://listen.camp/) every 4 weeks on a Sunday at 6pm CET (5pm in the UK). It is available to listen again soon after on the [CAMP Radio Mixcloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/camp_fr/).

At the moment it's anchored by David Carpenter, who keeps broadcast dates, track listings, artist information, and listen again links on [the radio page of The Argent Grub website](https://theargentgrub.co.uk/radio).
