Bradford Sound Artists - a group for people that work with sound and those that might want to - were meeting regularly at Fuse Art Space throughout 2023. The idea came from the people behind [Play Music](https://playmusicproject.org.uk/).

We're now meeting up randomly to work on various projects.

People of any level of ability, hobbyists and career musicians alike, are welcome to join us. 

## Multi-channel sound

FUSE is home to an eight speaker ambisonic set up which is available for people to use.

Read about our recent artist talks using the system:

* [Multi-channel Sound Workshop - Sophie Cooper]({% post_url 2022-10-01-multi-channel-sound %})
* [Tech Talk : Ben Eyes]({% post_url 2022-10-29-mc-sound-twp %})

## Bradford Sound Women Network

There is some cross over between Bradford Sound Artists and the [Bradford Sound Women Network](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100086324751416). They meet at Fuse Art Space on the first Saturday of the month.

<!--## Meetings

### Upcoming meetings/events
