Come curious and weâ€™ll supply the coffees and conversation to a new fortnightly meet-up at Fuse Art Space for people that work with sound and those that might want to.

In association with [Play Music](https://playmusicproject.org.uk/), we are inviting people of any level of ability, hobbyists and career musicians alike, to join us on alternative Wednesday lunchtimes and evenings. 

## Multi-channel sound

Fuse is home to an eight speaker ambisonic set up which is available for people to use.
