Just three of us today at the regular meeting, so we took the opportunity to set up a shared Google Drive folder, and train our selves on how to use it.

We also shared some sounds we'd been recording and creating and added some of those to the folder.

Claire also dropped in, getting ready for the [Bradford Sound Women Network Introductory Meet Up](https://www.facebook.com/events/473930954783121) which is this Saturday, 5th November, 11am at Fuse Art Space.
