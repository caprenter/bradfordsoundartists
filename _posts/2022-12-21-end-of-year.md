Our end of year meeting was a chance to meet up, reflect, and have some fun.

We had a good end to the year with a little party. 

We tried a lucky dip improv session which I was really fun and collaborative. People brought sound making devices, and were then asked to randomly select three items and to perform something with them. It would be to try that format again soon.

We ended the evening with some tunes from The Collector played from the turntables with vinyl records.
