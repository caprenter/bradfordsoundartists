Three of us met up to plot and plan for the coming year.

We also had a lof of general chat that covered a bunch of topics, some of which are collected below:

[A Sense of Place in Binlgey](https://asenseofplace.org.uk/2022/11/29/All-Saints-Bingley.html) - a collective listening event.

[Cities and Memory - Obsolete Sounds](https://citiesandmemory.com/obsolete-sounds/) - Obsolete Sounds is the world's biggest collection of disappearing sounds and sounds that have become extinct – remixed and reimagined to create a brand new form of listening.

[Eavesdrop](https://jameshamiltonmusic.bandcamp.com/album/eavesdrop) - Eavesdrop is a sonic nature trail taking place in the Yorkshire town of Otley over the summer of 2021 

[Otley Woodcock Walk](https://explore.echoes.xyz/collections/ZWLVjh5Ifdeho0mv) - A "poetry trail" celebrating the iconic woodcock, a bird synonymous with Otley and the town's history. 

Ideas for Sound art and [Bradford2025](https://bradford2025.co.uk) - capturing the audio from the year, as you might with photographs; woking across the entire district; what are 'Bradford sounds';

Do we need to constitute as a defined group to be ready for 2025?

Homework - maybe we should be setting ourselves tasks that help us engage in our practice. E.g. record 'transport' for next time. Bring some audio that has had delay/chorus/etc applied.
