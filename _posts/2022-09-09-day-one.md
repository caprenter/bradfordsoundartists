Eleven people answered the call to gather as Sound Artists at Fuse Art Space on Wednesday.

This is the start for a group for people interested in sound art to get together and share ideas.

In this meet-up, after a round of introductions, lots of brilliant suggestions were made for future meetings: activites, trips, workshops. Here are those ideas which we will pick-up when the group decides:
*  Field Recording Trip
*  Location sound, trying different microphone placesments
*  A demo of open source audio software
*  5 minute talk through your practice or a piece of work
*  Short film screening
*  Hands-on synthesiser demo
*  30-sec sound bring and share
