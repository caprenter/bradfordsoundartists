Since the start of the year we've met a few times to do a number of things and discussed a bunch of stuff...

Last night we had a brief look at some guitar effects - Tremolo, Chorus, Delay, Reverb.

We also talked about:

[Delia_Derbyshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delia_Derbyshire) and the [White Noise band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Noise_(band)) whjich led to this YouTube video of [David Vorhaus demonstrating the Kaleidophon (1976)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rRNM5n3jjQ).

[Pauline Oliveros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Oliveros) and her work on deep listening also came up.

## Next time

We're planning on making some sound to accompany video in our meeting on March 15th 2023. 

Most of this will be improvised on the night, so bring something to make sound (or you could use something that's lying around at Fuse). We'll see how it goes.
