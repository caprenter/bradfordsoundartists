Our second meeting was held on Wednesday evening on the 21st September 2022. We shared some sounds...

10 people came along and we spent most fo the evening listening to short clips of audio that people had brough with them.

There were reverberating claps, a table with contact microphones on it, a jogger on gravel, a person screaming in the night, an accapella group, a squeaky gate, synthesised milk bottles, a broken phone voice mail, and a train drone.

The discussion brought out a few tips and tricks, and more ideas for future meetings.

Next meeting will be at Gallery Two at Bradford Uni where we can all experience a new sound art exhibition. More details to follow.
