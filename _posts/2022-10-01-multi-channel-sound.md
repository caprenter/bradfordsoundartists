This event was to celebrate the launch of FUSEs in-house 'Diffused Sound System' - a re-configurable 8-channel speaker system. 

This was a workshop limited to a Womxn and Gender Minority audience based on an artist talk by [Sophie Cooper](https://sophiecoopermusic.com/).

In the session, Sophie went through her multi-channel pieces with the software instruments on screen, so we could follow through at each stage. We heard pieces on the bespoke sound system and were able to to ask questions throughout.

We hope this has inspired some people to explore the uses of multi-channel sound in their own work and to hopefully make use of our Diffused Sound System in the future.

A second event, open to everyone, takes place on 29th October. To book your place see: [Tech Talk : Ben Eyes on Saturday 29th October 2022](https://www.skiddle.com/whats-on/Bradford/Fuse-Art-Space/Tech-Talk--Ben-Eyes/36172281/)
