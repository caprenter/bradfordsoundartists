Great to see that Shabina Aslam's sound art installation [Bussing Out](https://theatreinthemill.com/bussing-out/) was featured in the Guardian the other day.

The article, [Uncovering Britainâ€™s secret history of bussing ethnic minority children](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/28/uncovering-britains-secret-history-of-bussing-ethnic-minority-children), was in The Guardian on Friday 28th October 2022.

We had an outing last month to see it, and you can [read about our visit to Bussing Out in this blog post]({% post_url 2022-10-05-bussing-out %}).  

The [Bussing Out](https://theatreinthemill.com/bussing-out/) exhibition is on show at Theatre in the Mill in Bradford until April 2023.
