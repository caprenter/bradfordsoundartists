Today we reflected on the evening we improvised and performed with each other.
As it was our first time doing this as a group, it was exciting and interesting to see what would come out of it.
We tried to recreate what each other was doing in our minds and realised we remembered quite a lot - where people were and what they were doing - but not entirely the details - what instruments each of us played and what we were playing.

We talked about what we might do differently if it happened again.
Suggestions included;
* considering pacing and silence as a sound, 
* taking turns as band leader or conductor, 
* picking a single silent film as score beforehand so we can look for cues and participation as an active listener in the audience.

Was feedback to the group important as a listener to the performance? Or was it just about the moment?

We also shared some new things that we found interesting, particularly about field recording.

The [Oxford Sound Album](https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/index.php/series/oxford-sound-album) presents a selection of favourite Oxford city soundscapes chosen by a group of people who rely on sound for spatial information, work with or study music, or both.

[Hear Be Dragons](https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/archived/soundproof/here-be-dragons/6847616) is Diane Hope's immersive audio guide to Shanghai, where you navigate by your ears not your eyes.

Martin also shared a recent attempt at capturing birdsong in a forest nearby.

> "Went out yesterday to try out new omni capsules on birdsong in local woods, found a good spot, waited twenty mins for wind to die down a bit and then pressed record and then a truck or some kind of heavy machinery arrived at the nearby football ground. Thought it was a dustbin wagon at first but it just went on and on, eventually went back home with nothing!"

He describes his setup as follows.

> "The recording was made with a pair of Sontronics STC-1 microphones with omni-directional capsules mounted onto a short (7") stereo bar with the mics angled outwards at 45 degrees. The stereo bar is mounted on a small travel tripod, it's too short for best results with omni microphones (I think about a metre apart sounds about right) but I don't want to carry two separate stands,  I have an idea for making a longer folding stereo bar. The recorder is a Zoom H5 which has phantom power for the microphones. The setup is getting a little on the heavy side for carrying about all day so I don't want to add any more unnecessary weight to the kit."
