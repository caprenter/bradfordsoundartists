At the last meeting we decided we would have an evening where we tried to improvise sound as a group to random videos.

We had a range of instruments, software, and hardware, and half a dozen music makers in the room. We had synths, live sampling, bass and effects, a keyboard with effects, a mini drum kit, guitar -and somewhere there's a recording of it all.

Martin took some photos of the whole thing.

The video we used was mostly drone footage of places - Chernobyl and Kiev before the war both featured - as did adverts that would pop up at times.

It was good fun, plenty of reflections - did we really play to the footage? What sparked the changes in the music? How did you make that sound? Would we do it differently next time?
