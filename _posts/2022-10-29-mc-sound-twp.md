Celebrating the launch of FUSE's in-house 'Diffused Sound System' - a re-configurable 8-channel speaker system - we invited two artists to talk about how they use multichannel sound in their practice. 

The second of those sessions took place on Saturday 29th October 2022 - a [separate event for womxn and gender minorities]({% post_url 2022-10-01-multi-channel-sound %}) ran earlier in the month. 

Ben showed us how he goes about setting-up systems like this all across the country, and how he approaches his composition and mixing strategies. 

He uses free-to-use software, so a few us were preprepared and set up so that we were able to follow along in our own copies.

We hope that this will lead to some of us exploring the uses of multi-channel sound in our own work and getting more hands on with the system at Fuse in the future.
